        <p>Daily Doise is a mobile application that uses visual recognition to process food images and analyze nutritious intake. It provides a historical log of diet enabling you to make healthy choices.</p>
        <p>It is built with React-Native with Expo.io and Redux for the front-end. For the back end, our team used Express to handle the user authentication and data retrieval, PostgresSQL and Sequelize to create the relational database. Daily Dose also incorporated a third-party API that uses AI and machine learning to identify food items in image, and Edamam API to provide a comprehensive nutrition analysis for each ingredient and dish. </p>
        <p>My role in this project was to create access to camera and gallery functionality and to connect Clarifai API ingredient output data with a photo page where users can submit their photo to confirm the final list of ingredients. I also pair-programed with one of my capstone team member to create a meal diary page so the user can store their data and checkout their previous meal.</p>
        <p>If you are more interesting how our team built this mobile application, please checkout our demo or Daily Doseâ€™s github page to see our code. </p>
